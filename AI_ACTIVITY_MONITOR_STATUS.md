## üß™ TESTING GUIDE

### Manual Testing (Fully Integrated Features)

#### Test 1: Job Extraction
1. Open application in browser
2. Look at header - AI Activity button should show "0"
3. Extract a new job via browser extension or URL
4. **Expected:**
   - AI Activity badge shows "1"
   - Brain icon starts pulsing
   - Click button to see dropdown
   - Task shows "Extracting job" with status icon
   - Progress bar moves through steps
   - Current step updates ("Fetching page...", "Parsing...", etc.)
   - When complete, task disappears
   - Can click task before completion to go to dashboard

#### Test 2: Salary Analysis
1. Go to any job page
2. Click "Salary Intelligence" tab
3. Click "Generate Analysis" button
4. **Expected:**
   - AI Activity badge increments
   - Task appears in dropdown: "Salary analysis"
   - Shows job title and company
   - Progress updates through steps
   - If cached, shows CACHED status immediately
   - When complete, task disappears
   - Can click task to go to job's salary tab

#### Test 3: Multiple Concurrent Tasks
1. Extract 2-3 jobs quickly
2. While extraction is running, open a job and run salary analysis
3. **Expected:**
   - All tasks appear in dropdown
   - Badge shows correct count (2, 3, etc.)
   - Each task updates independently
   - Can click any task to navigate
   - Tasks disappear as they complete
   - Badge count decreases accordingly

#### Test 4: Real-Time Updates
1. Open AI Activity dropdown
2. In another browser tab, extract a job or run analysis
3. **Expected:**
   - Task appears in dropdown without closing/reopening
   - Updates every 2 seconds
   - No need to refresh page

#### Test 5: Failed Task
1. Extract a job with invalid URL or run analysis without resume
2. **Expected:**
   - Task shows with red X icon
   - Error message displayed
   - Task stays visible (doesn't auto-hide)
   - Can still click to navigate

#### Test 6: Cached Analysis
1. Run salary analysis on a job
2. Wait for completion
3. Refresh page and run salary analysis again
4. **Expected:**
   - Task appears briefly
   - Immediately shows CACHED status (purple lightning icon)
   - Completes instantly
   - Returns cached data

### Edge Cases to Test
- [ ] Extract job with network error ‚Üí Should show FAILED
- [ ] Close browser during extraction ‚Üí Task should fail/retry
- [ ] Run analysis without resume ‚Üí Should fail gracefully
- [ ] Open 10+ tasks ‚Üí Badge should show "9+"
- [ ] Toggle "Active Only" / "View All" in dropdown
- [ ] Click outside dropdown ‚Üí Should close
- [ ] Navigate using task click ‚Üí Should go to correct page/tab

## üìä METRICS & MONITORING

### Database Queries
Monitor these queries for performance:
```sql
-- Active tasks (called every 2s per user)
SELECT * FROM AITask WHERE userId = ? AND status IN ('PENDING', 'PROCESSING') ORDER BY createdAt DESC;

-- Recent tasks (called on dropdown toggle)
SELECT * FROM AITask WHERE userId = ? ORDER BY updatedAt DESC LIMIT 20;
```

### API Endpoints Performance
- `/api/ai-tasks/stream` - Should maintain ~1 connection per active user
- `/api/ai-tasks/active` - Should respond in <50ms
- `/api/ai-tasks/recent` - Should respond in <100ms

### Task Lifecycle Metrics
Track these for insights:
- Average task duration by type
- Failure rate by type
- Cache hit rate
- Tasks created vs completed (should be equal over time)

---

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] Database migration applied
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors (some pre-existing errors remain)
- [ ] Complete remaining integrations (location, application, resume) - OPTIONAL
- [ ] Run manual tests on all features
- [ ] Check SSE connection limits (SQLite + Next.js)

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor SSE connections (should be ~1 per active user)
- [ ] Check database for orphaned tasks (should auto-cleanup after 24h)
- [ ] Verify real-time updates work in production
- [ ] Test on mobile browsers
- [ ] Monitor error logs for AI task failures

### Optional Improvements
- [ ] Add daily cleanup cron job: `aiTaskTracker.cleanupOldTasks(24)`
- [ ] Add Sentry/monitoring for task failures
- [ ] Add analytics for task types/durations
- [ ] Consider Redis pub/sub for scaling (if >100 concurrent users)
