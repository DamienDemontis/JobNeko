Act as a perfect professional software engineer. and a perfect wbe designer.

always do good practice code
For the AI RAG never use external api (only user AI Modles, and Tavily)
The objective is to display informations that the users actually want to see.
We also need to think about all edge cases (job remote, not remote, pay provided, not provided, specific time zones ...)
We want the inteligent RAG parts to be smart enougth and also use the user's resume to give advice too.
Make sure to respect IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER_PLAN.md, and to update your progress on it.
NEVER DO FALLBACK VALUES OR HARDODED DATA, i want only true ai results. I want them to be fast.
Always try not to duplicate code, always search if we don't have a system or component already in place. you can always modify them with props or other things to achieve your feature.
