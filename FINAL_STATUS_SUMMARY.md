## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

### Why Match Calculation Wasn't Showing
**Root Cause:** The `centralizedMatchService.calculateMatch()` method wasn't creating AI tasks.

**Fix Applied:** Added full AI task tracking to the centralized match service:
- Creates task when calculation starts
- Marks as CACHED if returning cached result
- Updates progress during analysis
- Completes task with result
- Handles failures

**Result:** Now ALL match calculations appear in monitor, regardless of where they're triggered from (Overview tab, auto-analysis, manual calculation, etc.)

### Why It's Important
The centralized match service is called by multiple features:
- Overview tab match score
- Application strategy analysis (uses match for context)
- Auto-analysis after extraction
- Manual "Calculate Match" button

By tracking at the service level, we ensure it appears in the monitor from ANY source.
